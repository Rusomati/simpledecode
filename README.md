this is a project made for fun that tries to decrypt [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher#Detection_and_cryptanalysis),
the project iterates over all possible keys(brute force) then checks result words against a dictionary
this is my biggest project yet and it probably has the most sane looking code, still it is not well optimised (object lifetimes and unecessary allocations)
and as of right now i 'have to' remove some redundant stuff also at the time of writing this utils is messed up
